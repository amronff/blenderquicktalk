#
# "Quicktalk" is a plugin for Blender which tries to do most of
# the dull boring work for lip-synch for a character.
#
# First, make shape keys for the mouth shapes.
# You'll need: AI, O, E, U, ETC, L, WQ, MBP, FV and the Basis should be a rest shape.
#
# Give it an armature if you don't already have one. It needs an armature to
# attach to the shape keys.
#
# Put the 3d cursor near the object's face. It's where we'll 
# create the panel of bones to control the shape-keys.
# Click the "Build Shape-Key Panel Armature" button.
# That'll build a panel of bones that control the shape-keys
# Each bone can be rotated from 0 to 90 degrees like
# a lever to control the expression. It'll build a lever
# for EVERY shape key so you can include blinks or
# smiles or whatever to get a lever for them too.
#
# Select a script file.
# Script files contain the dialogue the charters
# in the scene speak. Lines with a single word
# followed by a : mark changes in which character
# is speaking. The armatures attached to the
# character should be named the same as the
# name in the script. Well, first few chars
# have to match anyway.
# Lines which aren't a single word followed by
# a character are spoken by that character.
# Example (Obviously cut the #s off)
#
# ------------------
# Monkey:
# Hello I'm a monkey
# Welcome to my cartoon
# 
# Dog:
# Yes, and I'm a dog.
# 
# Monkey:
# Welcome to my cartoon dog.
# ------------------
#
# Click the "Guess Dialogue Markers" button.
# This will try to guess where in the timeline
# there's a change in who speaks and put markers
# there. It will be wrong, so adjust them so 
# they are right. You can make them yourself
# if you need to for some reason, they are just 
# normal markers but with names ending in "!D"
#
# When they're right click the "Guess Line Markers"
# which will add markers for each line that each
# character speaks. Again they'll be wrong and
# you'll have to adjust them. They end in "!L"
#
# When they're right click the "Guess Word Markers"
# button. It'll put markers for every spoken word.
# There's more chance this will be more or less
# right but still not much chance so fix 'em.
# Word markers end in "!W"
#
# Select an armature and click "QuickTalk Plot"
# This will create f-curves for the scene which
# change the x-rotation of the bones created in
# the panel. There's a pretty good chance this
# will look all right, but especially long words
# or where there's pauses in speech it'll still
# be wrong and you'll need to squash and scale
# the f-curve to match.
#
# If all that sounds long-winded, you do not understand
# how damn tedious lip-synching is when you have
# to do it literally frame by frame.
